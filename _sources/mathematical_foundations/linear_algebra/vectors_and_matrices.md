# Vectors and Matrices

Vectors and matrices are the fundamental building blocks of linear algebra. They are essential for representing data, performing calculations, and understanding transformations in machine learning. This section will provide a detailed explanation of vectors and matrices, their properties, and operations.

## Vectors

### Definition

A vector is an ordered collection of numbers, which can represent points in space, directions, or other quantities. Vectors are typically denoted by boldface letters (e.g., $\mathbf{v}$) or with an arrow above the letter (e.g., $\vec{v}$).

### Representation

Vectors can be represented in column form:

$$ \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix} $$

or in row form:

$$ \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} v_1 & v_2 & \cdots & v_n \end{bmatrix} $$

### Operations

#### Addition

Vector addition involves adding corresponding elements of two vectors. If $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are two vectors, their sum $\mathbf{w}$ is:

$$ \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} u_1 + v_1 \\ u_2 + v_2 \\ \vdots \\ u_n + v_n \end{bmatrix} $$

#### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication involves multiplying each element of a vector by a scalar (a single number). If $\mathbf{v}$ is a vector and $c$ is a scalar, the product $c\mathbf{v}$ is:

$$ c\mathbf{v} = c \begin{bmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ \vdots \\ v_n \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} cv_1 \\ cv_2 \\ \vdots \\ cv_n \end{bmatrix} $$

#### Dot Product

The dot product (or inner product) of two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ is a scalar defined as:

$$ \mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + \cdots + u_n v_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} u_i v_i $$

#### Norm

The norm (or magnitude) of a vector $\mathbf{v}$ is a measure of its length and is defined as:

$$ \|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + \cdots + v_n^2} = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n} v_i^2} $$

## Matrices

### Definition

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns. Matrices are typically denoted by uppercase letters (e.g., $A$).

### Representation

A matrix $A$ with $m$ rows and $n$ columns (an $m \times n$ matrix) can be written as:

$$ A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} $$

### Operations

#### Addition

Matrix addition involves adding corresponding elements of two matrices. If $A$ and $B$ are two matrices of the same dimension, their sum $C$ is:

$$ C = A + B = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} + \begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & \cdots & b_{1n} \\ b_{21} & b_{22} & \cdots & b_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ b_{m1} & b_{m2} & \cdots & b_{mn} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} + b_{11} & a_{12} + b_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} + b_{1n} \\ a_{21} + b_{21} & a_{22} + b_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} + b_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} + b_{m1} & a_{m2} + b_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} + b_{mn} \end{bmatrix} $$

#### Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication involves multiplying each element of a matrix by a scalar. If $A$ is a matrix and $c$ is a scalar, the product $cA$ is:

$$ cA = c \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \cdots & a_{1n} \\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} ca_{11} & ca_{12} & \cdots & ca_{1n} \\ ca_{21} & ca_{22} & \cdots & ca_{2n} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ ca_{m1} & ca_{m2} & \cdots & ca_{mn} \end{bmatrix} $$

#### Matrix Multiplication

Matrix multiplication involves multiplying two matrices. If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix and $B$ is an $n \times p$ matrix, their product $C$ is an $m \times p$ matrix defined as:

$$ C = AB = \begin{bmatrix} c_{11} & c_{12} & \cdots & c_{1p} \\ c_{21} & c_{22} & \cdots & c_{2p} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ c_{m1} & c_{m2} & \cdots & c_{mp} \end{bmatrix} $$

where each element $c_{ij}$ is computed as:

$$ c_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} b_{kj} $$

#### Transpose

The transpose of a matrix $A$ is a new matrix $A^T$ obtained by swapping the rows and columns of $A$. If $A$ is an $m \times n$ matrix, $A^T$ is an $n \times m$ matrix defined as:

$$ A^T = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} & \cdots & a_{m1} \\ a_{12} & a_{22} & \cdots & a_{m2} \\ \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\ a_{1n} & a_{2n} & \cdots & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix} $$

## Applications in Machine Learning

### Data Representation

Vectors and matrices are used to represent datasets, where rows often correspond to data points and columns correspond to features. This representation is essential for performing various machine learning operations and transformations.

### Linear Transformations

Matrices are used to perform linear transformations, such as scaling, rotation, and translation, which are fundamental operations in many machine learning algorithms.

### Solving Systems of Equations

Many machine learning algorithms, such as linear regression, involve solving systems of linear equations. Matrix operations provide efficient ways to find solutions to these systems.
