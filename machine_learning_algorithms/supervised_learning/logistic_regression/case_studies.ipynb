    "# Case Studies\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will explore real-world applications of logistic regression in various fields, including healthcare, finance, and marketing. These case studies demonstrate the practical utility and versatility of logistic regression in solving real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Real-World Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Healthcare\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is widely used in healthcare for predicting patient outcomes, understanding disease progression, and optimizing treatment plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predicting Disease Presence:**\n",
    "   Logistic regression can be used to predict the presence or absence of a disease based on clinical parameters and patient history. For example, it can predict the likelihood of a patient having diabetes based on features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Understanding Disease Progression:**\n",
    "   Logistic regression can help understand how different factors contribute to the progression of diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. For example, it can model the relationship between lifestyle factors and the progression of diabetes."
