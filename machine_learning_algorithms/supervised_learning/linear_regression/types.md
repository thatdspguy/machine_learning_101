### Types of Linear Regression

#### Simple Linear Regression

Simple linear regression models the relationship between a single independent variable and a dependent variable. It assumes that the relationship between the two variables can be described by a straight line.

**Assumptions:**
- There is a linear relationship between the independent and dependent variables.
- The residuals (differences between observed and predicted values) are normally distributed.
- The residuals have constant variance ([homoscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity_and_heteroscedasticity)).

#### Multiple Linear Regression

Multiple linear regression extends simple linear regression by modeling the relationship between two or more independent variables and a dependent variable. It allows for more complex relationships and interactions among variables.

**Assumptions:**
- There is a linear relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable.
- The residuals are normally distributed.
- The residuals have constant variance ([homoscedasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoscedasticity_and_heteroscedasticity)).
- There is no perfect multicollinearity (independent variables are not perfectly correlated).

By understanding these theoretical foundations, you will be better equipped to build, interpret, and evaluate linear regression models. In the following sections, we will delve into the details of model training, evaluation, and practical considerations.
