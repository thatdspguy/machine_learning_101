    "# Bayes' Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory and statistics that describes the relationship between conditional probabilities. It provides a mathematical framework for updating the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence and is essential for many machine learning algorithms and inferential statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem is expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $P(A|B)$ is the posterior probability, the probability of hypothesis $A$ given the evidence $B$.\n",
    "- $P(B|A)$ is the likelihood, the probability of evidence $B$ given that hypothesis $A$ is true.\n",
    "- $P(A)$ is the prior probability, the initial probability of hypothesis $A$ before observing the evidence $B$.\n",
    "- $P(B)$ is the marginal probability, the total probability of the evidence $B$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intuition\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes' Theorem allows us to update our beliefs about the probability of a hypothesis based on new evidence. It combines the prior probability with the likelihood of the new evidence to produce the posterior probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Medical Diagnosis\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose a patient undergoes a test for a rare disease. The test is 99% accurate, meaning it correctly identifies 99% of diseased and 99% of healthy individuals. The disease affects 1 in 10,000 people. We want to find the probability that the patient has the disease given a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $P(\\text{Disease}) = 0.0001$ (prior probability)\n",
    "- $P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{Disease}) = 0.99$ (likelihood)\n",
    "- $P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{No Disease}) = 0.01$ (false positive rate)\n",
    "- $P(\\text{No Disease}) = 1 - P(\\text{Disease}) = 0.9999$\n",
    "\n",
    "We need to calculate $P(\\text{Positive Test})$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{Positive Test}) = P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{Disease})P(\\text{Disease}) + P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{No Disease})P(\\text{No Disease}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = (0.99 \\times 0.0001) + (0.01 \\times 0.9999) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = 0.000099 + 0.009999 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = 0.010098 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can use Bayes' Theorem to find the posterior probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ P(\\text{Disease}|\\text{Positive Test}) = \\frac{P(\\text{Positive Test}|\\text{Disease})P(\\text{Disease})}{P(\\text{Positive Test})} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{0.99 \\times 0.0001}{0.010098} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ = \\frac{0.000099}{0.010098} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\approx 0.0098 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that the patient has the disease given a positive test result is approximately 0.98%.\n",

    "### Naive Bayes Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "The Naive Bayes classifier is a simple yet powerful probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' Theorem. It assumes that the features are conditionally independent given the class label, which simplifies the computation of the posterior probabilities.\n",
